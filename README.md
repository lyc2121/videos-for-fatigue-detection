# videos-for-fatigue-detection
There are 15 volunteers to drive in a simulated environment with a camera that has similar positioning and distance and changes in lighting conditions. There are 26 videos which contains 23 test videos performed by 15 different volunteers and 3 test real bus videos. They contain four different scenes: daytime driving with masks, daytime driving without masks, nighttime driving with masks, and nighttime driving without masks. Each video sequence has two different phases: blink normally in the first 10 seconds; the other time is simulated normal driving. we have labeled eyes state frame-by-frame for each video manually.
